# Weather App
## What it does:
The Weather App is a weather forecast app designed to tell the user the current temperature, wind speed and precipitation for the current hour, day as well as week. It's currently available online at *https://weather-app-25sam18.netlify.app/*.
## Technologies used:
The app was built with Vite and written in JavaScript along with some HTML and CSS. The Open-Meteo API was used to get the weather data and Netlify was used to host it.
## Why said technologies:
The purpose of the project was to expand my knowledge on JavaScript and learn how to use APIs. Open-Meteo was chosen because it's free and working.
## How to install it:
You don't need to install it as it's available online but if you want to, all you have to do is run the *npm i* command in the terminal to install all of the dependancies. To start the app you need to execute: *npm run dev*.
## How to use it:
In order for the app to work (or even load) you need to give it permission to use your location to get the local weather data. Then, at the top the you'll be able to see the current temperature as well as the daily high and low temp., how they feel like, and the current wind speed and precipitation. Below that are seven cards for each day of the week which tell the you the day and what the temperature will be like along with an icon showing if it'll be sunny, cloudy, rainy, or a mix of them. After that you'll see the hourly temperature for the whole week along with how it feels like as well as the wind speed and the precipitation.
